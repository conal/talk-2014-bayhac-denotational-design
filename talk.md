In programming, we want precise, elegant, reusable abstractions.
Where have such things been developed?
Abstract algebra.
That's where to look.
In Haskell, abstract algebra appears as standard type classes with laws.
Moreover, the notion of homomorphism captures non-leaky abstractions.

Start with this quote about abstraction:
"The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise." - Edsger Dijkstra
